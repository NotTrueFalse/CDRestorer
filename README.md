# CDRestorer
a simple script that can create a bin image of any cd / dvd, you simply put the drive letter and it'll restore the most part of it, 
even if there are some bad sectors, it will write 0s instead of random stuff.

It work pretty simply, change letter to the letter of your cd drive you want to backup, then run python main.py
Bad and skipped sectors are saved in two separated files.
